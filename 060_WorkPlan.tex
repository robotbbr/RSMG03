\chapter{Work Plan}

The main goal for this project is to present a concise study of the integration of ASP and robotics, particularly related to the problem of activity recognition.
Meanwhile, a strategy should proposed to achieve the goal:


\section{Short-term goals}

In the short term, the focus is understanding and implementation.
The work will be oriented with two purposes.

\begin{itemize}
\item Get a deeper understanding of ASP, and particularly in the context of robotics.
\item Board the problem of activity recognition with simple cases.
\end{itemize}

The first point is mentioned because ASP has a central role in this project, is important to complete a proper analysis from insight about the possibilities and requirements to achieve the goal.
This includes the possible synergy with ASP and other techniques (e.g. probabilistic approaches) to improve the possibilities of an overall system.

Regarding the second point, activity recognition is the problem to treated.
A simple solution should be built, in order to have a platform for testing and also build more complex implementations.

\section{Long-term goals}

In the long term, the work will be directed towards testing, analysis and evaluation. 
Testing is required to demonstrate the applicability of different ideas and to measure their performance.
Then, the results should be analysed to obtain metrics required to direct the proposed approach towards efficiency and reliability; to distinguish good and bad practices.
Finally, the obtained results should be submitted to evaluation, principally external evaluation.
As mentioned in chapter \ref{ch_relatedwork}, the topic has a broad literature, there are a lot of expert researches that can judge the work in this project and different approaches to compare; this will provide a valuable feedback for a continuous improvement.
