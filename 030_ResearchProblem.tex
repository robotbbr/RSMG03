\chapter{Research Problem}

The last chapter introduced activity recognition, ASP and semantic mapping.
This chapter presents the central problem in this project: activity recognition with a mobile robot using ASP.
Emphasis is made in handling incomplete information from the robot's sensors and in the integration of activities in a semantic map.

\section{Problem}

% Description of the problem

The subject of study in this project is \textbf{activity recognition with a mobile robot}.
Emphasis is put on cases with incomplete information and the integration of the results in a semantic map that can be used by a robot for cognitive purposes.

As mentioned before, a mobile robot is an ideal platform to be used for activity recognition. 
Mobility in an advantage for the robot, in comparison with the systems that use fixed cameras and a fixed point of view; a robot is an active observer.
However, using a robot implies a trade-off, some new challenges arise, as motion planning, 3D perception, moving and erratic sensors, not having control of the environment, etc.
Particularly interesting, in this project, is to face the problem of activity recognition with incomplete information.
It is clear that a mobile robot will work win this condition most of the time, for many reasons, the environment is non deterministic, sensory data is not available (e.g. occlusions) or because the robot is not omnipresent.
%TODO Main sentence for the problem

With this in mind, the strategy is to study this problem by applying novel techniques in this context. Particularly ASP, as %TODO EXPAND

The application domain will dictate the activities to be recognized, the required precision, the sensors to be used and their location (environment located or wearable), the time constraints for deliberation,



%The main goal is to automatically analyse the ongoing activities from a sensory source (a video sequence in most of the cases).

%Activities can be understood in physical terms (space and time), but also symbolically as they can usually be associated with a meaning and a context. 

%Human activities are difficult to classify because they cover a broad range of situations and they depend on different parameters.
%Regarding their complexity, activities can be treated as hierarchical entities because high-level activities are usually composed of simpler actions.
Regarding the complexity of the activities, in \citep{Turaga2008_MaRecHuAcSurv}, two non-exclusive categories are used: actions and activities.
The first one is used for simple actions performed preferably by a individual, and activities are treated as a complex sequence of actions performed by several individuals. 
On a similar fashion, in \citep{Aggarwal11_HumanActivity}, a four layers categorization is proposed:

\begin{description}
\item[Gestures] Elementary movements of a person's body part, and are the atomic components describing a meaningful motion of a person. 
E.g. `stretching an arm', `raising a leg'.
\item[Actions] Single person activities that may be composed of multiple gestures organized temporally. 
E.g. `walking', `waving'.
\item[Interacions] Human activities that involve two or more persons and/or objects. 
E.g. `Two persons fighting', `a person eating an apple'.
\item[Group activities] The activities performed by conceptual groups of multiple persons and/or objects. 
E.g. `a football team playing a match', `a group of students making an exam'.
