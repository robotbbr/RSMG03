\section{Human activity analysis}
% Description of the problem

% Alternatives for each part
% > Observations
% > Knowledge (where? & how?, I'll do it by hand, but it's important to mention alternatives).
% > Representations
% *** CHECK THE orgnanization from the surveys
%   - Modelling activities in space (QSR)
%   - Modelling activities in time  (QSTR ~ Allen's, Fluent, Event, etc).
%   - Modelling activities semantically (Ontologies + Hierarchies)
% > Inference

% Test example

\section{Proposal} % Or alternatives

% Main parts of the problem

% A - Scene decomposition (locations, objects, persons)
%   > from observations to scene reconstruction

% B - 

% B - Representation 
% Modelling in space (QSR)
% Modelling in time (QSTR)
